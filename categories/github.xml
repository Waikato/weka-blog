A recent question on the Weka mailing list was whether the software also outputs micro-averaged precision, recall, and F-measure for multi-class problems. It turns out that it does! To find out where these can be found, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

This post provides some explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

To see what needs to be done, read on!&lt;/p&gt;

made a notice available when logging into the wiki:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Notice&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;"Over the last twelve months we have been carrying out a complete technical
review of the infrastructure and software we use to serve Wikispaces users.
As part of the review, it has become apparent that the required investment to
bring the infrastructure and code in line with modern standards is very
substantial. We have explored all possible options for keeping Wikispaces
running but have had to conclude that it is no longer viable to continue to
run the service in the long term. So, it is with no small degree of
nostalgia, that we will begin to close down later this year."&lt;/dd&gt;

having access to the latest code, we have been looking into
ways of bringing Weka to Github. Especially, since our
faculty already has an organizational account &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Waikato"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Weka was original stored in a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;
repository and then got migrated to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;. Not only has it a lot of branches, not all of
them are publicly available, like commercial ones. This all
complicated the migration to Github.&lt;/p&gt;
