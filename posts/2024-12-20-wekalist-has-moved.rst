Unfortunately, the university mailman server was being decommissioned and the Wekalist had
to find a new home. Its home is now on Sourceforge.net, where all the Weka releases and
packages are hosted as well:

`https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/lists/weka-users <https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/lists/weka-users>`__

You can find the mailing list archives here from now on:

`https://sourceforge.net/p/weka/mailman/weka-users/ <https://sourceforge.net/p/weka/mailman/weka-users/>`__

Due to the move, you will have to subscribe again before you can post to the list
using the following email address:

`weka-users@lists.sourceforge.net <mailto:weka-users@lists.sourceforge.net>`__
